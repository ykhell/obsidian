Since f is differentiable on (0, 2) and its derivative f'(x) is bounded by 5 for all x in (0, 2), by the mean value theorem, for any x1, x2 in (0, 2), there exists a c in (0, 2) such that:

f(x2) - f(x1) = f'(c)(x2 - x1)

So the function f is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant 5.

A Lipschitz-continuous function with Lipschitz constant L satisfies the property that the distance between the values of the function at any two points is less than or equal to L times the distance between the points.

In other words,

|f(x2) - f(x1)| <= L * |x2 - x1|

Applying this to x1 = 0 and x2 = 2, we get:

|f(2) - f(0)| <= 5 * |2 - 0| = 10

So, we can say that f(2) - f(0) <= 10 and f(2) - f(0) >= -10

Given that f(0) = -3, we can say that:

-3 - f(2) <= 10 and -3 - f(2) >= -10

Therefore, f(2) <= 7 and f(2) >= -13

Thus the maximum value of f(2) can be at most 7.
