Ignition timing or Spark timing is the angle of the crankshaft at the start of the ignition event.

The ignition timing is often advanced such that peak pressure is reached after top dead center, i. e. when the piston has already changed direction, in which case the peak pressure will push it down more effectively.

The ideal timing for ignition is dependent on a lot of factors, including engine speed.
