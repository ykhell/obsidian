Instead of a spark plug you have fuel injectors, where the cycle looks like this:
Stroke 1 - Only air enters the cylinder
Stroke 2 - Air gets compressed (very high compression ratio)
Stroke 3 - Diesel is injected and automatically combusts beacuse of the high air pressure and temperature.
Stroke 4 - Exhaust gasses
