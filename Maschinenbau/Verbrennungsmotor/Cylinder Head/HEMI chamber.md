A Hemispherical shape for the cylinder head, better than a flat head but awkward for 4 valve designs.
Theoretically they should be the most efficient design. But due to their surface area they end up soaking up alot of the heat produced in the cylinder. heat is power
The HEMI is an obsolete design no longer in use except in classic cars. So it has no relevance to us or any other discussion of modern engines.
The modern HEMI isn't a HEMI at all. It's a pent-roof.
