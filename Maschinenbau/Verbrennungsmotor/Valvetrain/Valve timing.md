3 Elements can be controlled
- When the valves open
- Duration of the opening
- The lift of the valve (how deep it does it move inside the cylinder)

Variable valve timing is useful for choking performance engines in order to achieve a virtually smaller displacement and thus a higher fuel efficiency.
