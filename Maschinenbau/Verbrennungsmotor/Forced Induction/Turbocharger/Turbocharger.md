Two Distinct Parts:
1. Hot Side which houses the turbine wheel
2. Cold Side which houses the compressor wheel

Mechanism:
1. The Exhaust gasses spin the turbine wheel which in turn spins the compressor wheel. 
2. The compressor wheel sucks in fresh air and compresses it. 

The compression increases the temperatur of the air, and thus needs an intercooler to prevent pre-igniting.

A Wastegate controlls the compression

The Turbine Wheel is connected to the Compressor Wheel via a common Shaft.

The Hot Side is connected to the engine.

The Flange is the connecting part of the turbo which gets bolted onto the exhaust manifold. 
There are many types of Flanges.
