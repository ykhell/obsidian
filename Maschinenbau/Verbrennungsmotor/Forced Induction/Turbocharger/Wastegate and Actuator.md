The Wastegate is a valve that controls the flow of exhaust gasses to the turbine wheel in a turbocharged engine. It is meant to regulate the maximum boost pressure in order to protect the engine and the turbocharger.

The wastegate is made from a diaphragm/spring setup which is connected to the compressor housing. The spring is configured to activate the bypass valve in the turbine housing via the actuator when the boost exceeds a specific pressure level.
