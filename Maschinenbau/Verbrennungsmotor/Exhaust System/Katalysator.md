Redox-Reaction based exhaust emission control device
## Placement
Catalytic converters require a temperature of 400 °C (752 °F) to operate effectively. Therefore, they are placed as close to the engine as possible, or one or more smaller catalytic converters (known as "pre-cats") are placed immediately after the exhaust manifold.
