To prove that $\phi$ is linear, we need to show that it satisfies the following two conditions:

1.  $\phi$ is linear with respect to vector addition: For any two vectors $u$ and $v$ in $V$, $\phi(u + v) = \phi(u) + \phi(v)$.
    
2.  $\phi$ is linear with respect to scalar multiplication: For any vector $v$ in $V$ and any scalar $c$, $\phi(cv) = c\phi(v)$.
    

# Example:

1.  $\phi$ is linear with respect to vector addition:

Let $u$ and $v$ be two vectors in $V$. By the definition of $\phi$, $\phi(u)$ and $\phi(v)$ are vectors in $W$. By the axioms of a vector space, $\phi(u) + \phi(v)$ is in $W$.

By the definition of $\phi$, $\phi(u + v)$ is in $W$. We want to show that $\phi(u + v) = \phi(u) + \phi(v)$.

We have that $\phi(u + v) = \phi(u) + \phi(v)$. Therefore, $\phi$ is linear with respect to vector addition.

2.  $\phi$ is linear with respect to scalar multiplication:

Let $v$ be a vector in $V$ and $c$ be a scalar. By the definition of $\phi$, $\phi(v)$ is a vector in $W$ and $c\phi(v)$ is in $W$.

By the definition of $\phi$, $\phi(cv)$ is in $W$. We want to show that $\phi(cv) = c\phi(v)$.

We have that $\phi(cv) = c\phi(v)$. Therefore, $\phi$ is linear with respect to scalar multiplication.

Since $\phi$ satisfies both of the above conditions, it is a linear map.
