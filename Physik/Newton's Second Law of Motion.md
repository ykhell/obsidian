There exist frames of reference in which the motion of the particle is described by the [[Differenzielle Gleichung|differential equation]] 
$$\mathbf F = \frac{d\mathbf p}{dt} \equiv \dot{\mathbf p} $$
$$ \mathbf F = \frac{d}{dt} m\mathbf v$$
In most cases, the mass of the particle is constant and we get
$$ \mathbf F = m\frac{d\mathbf v}{dt} = m\mathbf a$$
where $\mathbf a$ is the acceleration [[Vektor]] defined by $$\mathbf a = \frac{d^2\mathbf r}{dt^2}$$
