The work being done by the external Force $\mathbf F$ upon the particle in going from point 1 to 2 is defined to be
$$W_{12} = \int_1^2 \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf s$$
where $s$ denotes displacement, so
$$\int \mathbf F \cdot ds = m\int \frac{d\mathbf v}{dt} \cdot \mathbf vdt = \frac{m}{2} \int \frac{d}{dt} (v^2)dt$$
$$W_{12} = \frac{m}{2}(v_2^2 - v_1^2)$$
The scalar quantity $mv^2 / 2$ is the [[kinetic energy]] and is denoted by $T$. the work is equal to the change in $T$
$$W_{12} = \Delta T = T_2 - T_1$$
