** TODO p-adic mean value theorem
** Derivatives:
+ There exist Injective Functions with derivative zero at some points, so the zero derivative does not imply that a function is locally constant in $\Bbb Q_p$
** Integration:
+ The Fundamental theorem of calculus does not hold in $\Bbb Q_P$
+ Integrals and Antiderivatives are not related
+ No good general theory for Antiderivatives
+ There is no translation invariant bounded $\Bbb Q_p$-valued measure on $\Bbb Z_p$.
+ There is no perfect theory of integration
  This leads to two possible theories of integration:
  1. Accept unbounded measures: leads to Volkenborn integral and Mahler's theory of continuous p-adic function.
  2. Drop translation invariance: leads to p-adic interpolation problems
** TODO Haar Measure
Qp is a locally compact abelian additive group, so it carries a Haar measure, which is translation invariant.
So it makes it easy to integrate functions $f : Q_p \to R$.
